Hey, it's Nate! This is a blog/devlog where I write about stuff I'm interested in (these days that's Rust, ML, and infra).

## About Me { #about-me }

I'm an AI engineer from Canada currently working in Paris. Before that, I went to school at [Queen's](https://www.queensu.ca/) and [Polimi](https://www.polimi.it/) where I studied applied math.

I am a hobbyist Rust programmer, mainly working on projects related to ML & statistical learning and contributing in my own capacity to [open-source projects](https://github.com/search?q=org:meilisearch+author:nnethercott&type=commits). I've been using the language since 2023, but actually earn a living working in Python.
